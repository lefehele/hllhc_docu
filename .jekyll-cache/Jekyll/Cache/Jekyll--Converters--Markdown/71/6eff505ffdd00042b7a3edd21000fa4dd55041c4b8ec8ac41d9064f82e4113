I"2<p>In 2025, the LHC will be upgraded to the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), a project which will improve the luminosity of the accelerator and consequently the rate of collisions at the beam crossings. The design luminosity for the HL-LHC is 5 Ã— 1034 cm-2 s-1 which is expected to increase the data sample by one order of magnitude compared to the nominal LHC design. The non-collision beam background reaching the ATLAS detector will increase during the HL-LHC running. Studies of beam halo and beam-gas backgrounds are performed using the BDSIM simulation software with input from MADX and SixTrack and losses are recorded at the ATLAS interface plane (~22.5m from IP1). Also the effect of passive absorbers (TAXN, TAXS) on background is presented. Results are compared to previous studies of the LHC and HL-LHC.</p>
